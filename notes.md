- Create one page app 
    - [] 


Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Use at least 3 unique event-listeners (Links to an external site.) that enable interactivity. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should have its own unique callback function.

Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.\

This is what I need from you by the beginning of the day Monday(08/22):
Create a GitHub repo, add all of your group members as contributors to the project, and create a 1-2 sentence pitch about your project
Create a list of user stories, this is just a statement about what your app will do, it’s usually in the format of “As a user, I can fill out a form”, or “As a user, I can press buttons”. This will help you have a better understanding of what features you want for your project.
Create some wireframes: https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/10-free-to-use-wireframing-tools images for your web page.
Lastly, add your pitch, user stories, and wireframe images to your readme file, and DM me the link to your repos by Monday.
